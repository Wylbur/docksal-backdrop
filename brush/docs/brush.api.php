/* All brush commands are invoked in a specific order, using
 * brush-made hooks, very similar to the Backdrop hook system. See brush_invoke()
 * for the actual implementation.
 *
 * For any commandfile named "hook", the following hooks are called, in
 * order, for the command "COMMAND":
 *
 * 0. brush_COMMAND_init()
 * 1. brush_hook_COMMAND_validate()
 * 2. brush_hook_pre_COMMAND()
 * 3. brush_hook_COMMAND()
 * 4. brush_hook_post_COMMAND()
 *
 * For example, here are the hook opportunities for a mysite.brush.inc file
 * that wants to hook into the `pm-download` command.
 *
 * 1. brush_mysite_pm_download_validate()
 * 2. brush_mysite_pre_pm_download()
 * 3. brush_mysite_pm_download()
 * 4. brush_mysite_post_pm_download()
 *
 * Note that the brush_COMMAND_init() hook is only for use by the
 * commandfile that defines the command.
 *
 * If any of hook function fails, either by calling brush_set_error
 * or by returning FALSE as its function result, then the rollback
 * mechanism is called.  To fail with an error, call brush_set_error:
 *
 *   return brush_set_error('MY_ERROR_CODE', bt('Error message.'));
 *
 * To allow the user to confirm or cancel a command, use brush_confirm
 * and brush_user_abort:
 *
 *   if (!brush_confirm(bt('Are you sure?'))) {
 *     return brush_user_abort();
 *   }
 *
 * The rollback mechanism will call, in reverse, all _rollback hooks.
 * The mysite command file can implement the following rollback hooks:
 *
 * 1. brush_mysite_post_pm_download_rollback()
 * 2. brush_mysite_pm_download_rollback()
 * 3. brush_mysite_pre_pm_download_rollback()
 * 4. brush_mysite_pm_download_validate_rollback()
 *
 * Before any command is called, hook_brush_init() is also called.
 * hook_brush_exit() is called at the very end of command invocation.
